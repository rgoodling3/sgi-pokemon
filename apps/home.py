        1. Fetch the data from [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page).
        2. Preprocess the data: create list of Pokemon per generation, select information about occuring pokemon per
        each episode, select information about Pokemon occuring in each routes.
        3. Divide work into three parts and create seperate sections:
        - pokemon-episodes graph
        - pokemon-routes graph
        - sentiment analysis of pokemons belonging to the same **Type** category
        More information can be found in the relevant sections.
